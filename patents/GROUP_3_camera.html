<p>
<em>In a wrist-carried camera having a watch function, a body including a taking lens is provided in such a manner as to freely rotate with respect to a band part through a rotation mechanism, and a release switch is provided at the unrotated band part. Setting a camera mode stops the hands of the watch in the direction of a taking lens so as to display an image-capturing direction. A rotary bezel is arranged around a display part, and marks indicating modes of the camera are formed on the bezel. A hand of the watch is also used as an indicator for pointing the mode display mark in the bezel. Setting the mark in the bezel to the indicator switches and displays the operation modes.</em>
