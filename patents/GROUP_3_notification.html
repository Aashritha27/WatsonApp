<em>The present invention provides a polymerizable monomer, a liquid crystal composition containing the polymerizable monomer and a vertical alignment liquid crystal panel. The polymerizable monomer which the present invention provides may generate free radicals more easily under the UV exposure, so as to solve the RM residue due to the improvement of the curing ability of the RM and thus improve the image sticking issue of the liquid crystal panel.</em>
