<h1>alarm</h1>

<p>
<em>A device configured for capture of activity data for a user includes a housing, a sensor, a motor, a memory, and a processor. The sensor is disposed in the housing to capture physical contact upon the housing. The motor causes vibration of the housing. The memory stores an alarm setting that defines a time of day for triggering an alarm on the device. The processor activates the alarm upon reaching the time of day defined by the alarm setting, with the alarm causing the motor to produce the vibration of the housing. The sensor, which is interfaced with the processor, is configured to detect a physical contact upon the housing. The processor is configured to deactivate the alarm if the physical contact qualifies as an input to deactivate the alarm. The deactivating of the alarm causes the vibration of the device to be suspended.</em>
