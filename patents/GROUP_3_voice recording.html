<p>
<em>A wearable accoutrement such as a wristwatch records noises within a wearer's vicinity, and white noises may be filtered out to output pure human voices. The voice recording feature can be activated manually or automatically during a “panic mode” as indicated by a loud noise or sudden biological changes such as an increase in heart rate or body temperature. The accoutrement can also monitor other environmental elements such as light, motion and audio and may be paired with a wireless phone such that noise from a stressful event can be sent to a remote server which processes the data. A motion sensor in the accoutrement may also activate an audible alarm in the event of physical trauma to the wearer to induce an attacker to flee.</em>
