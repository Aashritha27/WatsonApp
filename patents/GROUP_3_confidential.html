The method is implemented on a computing system and includes receiving a plurality of data for display on a display on the computing system, determining what is sensitive data from the plurality of data, and transmitting that which as been determined to be sensitive data apart from the plurality of data to an auxiliary system. In this manner, sensitive data can be perceived privately and as desired or programmed, ordinary data can be displayed on a primary visual device.</em>
