<em>A watch capable of playing sound includes a main body and a sound playing body. The main body includes an interface unit, a signal amplification unit, a control unit, and a first electromagnetic coil unit. The control unit transmits audio signal to the signal amplification unit via the interface unit. The first electromagnetic coil unit generates inducted electromagnetic filed in response to the audio signal amplified by the signal amplification unit. The sound playing body includes a second electromagnetic coil unit and a loudspeaker. The second electromagnetic coil unit generates electric signal in response to the induced electromagnetic filed. The loudspeaker plays the audio signal in response to the electric signal.</em>
