<em>A watch includes a main body and a sound input body. The sound input body includes a microphone, a signal transmitting coil unit, a power receiving coil unit, and a power receiving unit. The main body includes an interface unit, a signal receiving coil unit coupling the signal transmitting coil unit, a signal amplification unit, a power transmitting unit, a power transmitting coil unit, and a control unit. The microphone converts a voice signal input to an electric signal, which is transmitted to the control unit by the signal transmitting coils coupling with the signal receiving coils. The control unit executes corresponding function in response to the electric signal. The electric signal obtained by the control unit is transmitted to the power receiving unit by the power transmitting coils coupling with the power receiving coils to power the microphone.</em>
