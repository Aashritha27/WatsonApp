nltk, wordnet for word associations, synonyms
    wordnet is a lexicaldatabase
tfidf, could give it some sappy name like ifidf, (idea frequency) cfidf, (concept frequency),
or maybe that's too lame. 
    The idea is that we compute tfidf for the query terms, but considering all 
    synonyms given by wornet. That'll change the computation, and will have a 
    summation, and divide by the n synonyms probably, then the whole log stuff with regular tfidf.
    -Will look fancy and mathematical for the business 
    -will be accurate and good probably, I'll check it out.
